# Custom PHPStan Rules

Project-specific PHPStan rules that enforce architectural patterns and prevent bug classes.

Deployed by php-qa-ci. Method: https://defence-before-fix.github.io/ (specification), first
published at https://ltscommerce.dev/articles/defence-before-fix-static-analysis. The procedure
this project follows is `vendor/lts/php-qa-ci/CLAUDE/DefenceBeforeFix.md`, invoked through the
`defence-before-fix` skill.

## Creating a New Rule

Before writing a PHPStan rule, confirm it is not a structural naming/layering/dependency rule — those belong in PHPArkitect (see php-qa-ci README "Where does a rule belong").

### 1. Create the Rule Class

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace QaConfig\PHPStan\Rules;

use PhpParser\Node;
use PHPStan\Analyser\Scope;
use PHPStan\Rules\Rule;
use PHPStan\Rules\RuleErrorBuilder;

/**
 * Rule description: what pattern this catches and why it is dangerous.
 *
 * @implements Rule<Node\SomeNodeType>
 */
final class YourNewRule implements Rule
{
    public function getNodeType(): string
    {
        return Node\SomeNodeType::class;
    }

    /**
     * @return list<\PHPStan\Rules\IdentifierRuleError>
     */
    public function processNode(Node $node, Scope $scope): array
    {
        // Detection logic here
        // Return empty array if no violation
        // Return array with RuleErrorBuilder if violation found
        return [
            RuleErrorBuilder::message('Clear explanation of what is wrong and how to fix it')
                ->identifier('yourRule.violationType')
                ->build(),
        ];
    }
}
```

### 2. Register in phpstan.neon

```neon
rules:
    - QaConfig\PHPStan\Rules\YourNewRule
```

### 3. Test the Rule

Run PHPStan to verify the rule catches the pattern:

```bash
export CI=true && bin/qa -t stan
```

## Defence Before Fix Pattern

When creating rules as part of the "Defence Before Fix" strategy:

1. **Analyse** -- Understand the bug pattern from production incident
2. **Create Rule** -- Write a PHPStan rule that catches ALL instances of the pattern
3. **Run PHPStan** -- Verify the rule detects existing violations
4. **TDD** -- Write failing tests for the specific bugs
5. **Fix** -- Implement fixes, then verify both PHPStan and tests pass

The rule creates permanent defence -- the bug class can never recur in future commits.

**Net and Filter:** the static rule is the NET (catches the whole class structurally,
permanently); TDD is the FILTER (reproduces the specific instance on the production path
and proves the fix). Belt and braces — neither alone suffices.

**Wire, don't delete.** When a rule goes RED, fix by WIRING the flagged contract to a
real producer, proven by a production-path test. Deleting the flagged element to silence
the rule bakes in the broken / half-built state — only delete when it is genuinely
unwanted dead code (a deliberate scope decision).

**Coverage theatre:** a test fixture that feeds a value production never sets yields
false-green coverage and proves nothing — drive the real producer, not a hand-fed value.

**Nullable ⇒ both paths:** a nullable member is two code paths; prove BOTH (with-value
AND null). Prefer non-nullable where null is not a genuinely valid state.

Full philosophy: `vendor/lts/php-qa-ci/CLAUDE/DefenceBeforeFix.md`.

## Namespace

- **Namespace:** `QaConfig\PHPStan\Rules`
- **Autoloaded via:** `composer.json` `autoload-dev` PSR-4 entry mapping
  `QaConfig\` to `qaConfig/`
- **Available types:** Use `PhpParser\Node\*` for AST nodes, `PHPStan\Analyser\Scope`
  for type information

## Important

- NEVER put rules in `src/PHPStan/` -- that is production code
- PHPStan and PhpParser are dev-only dependencies
- Rules must return `list<\PHPStan\Rules\IdentifierRuleError>` (use `RuleErrorBuilder`)
- Use `.identifier()` on every error for baseline management
- Error messages should explain both WHAT is wrong and HOW to fix it
